    "One day, I walked into the woodshop for a shift and found at least 30 nicely-planed, fifteen-feet-long slabs of cedar magically sitting there. I was immediately drawn to two things: the warm musky scent of the tree, and the soft, curvy edges of the slabs. At the time, I needed a tray to hold dining table essentials like napkins and salt/pepper grinders. I then thought, can I make one out of these spectacular pieces of softwood, but somehow preserve the softness and gentle curve of their edges?",
    "The idea came for me to use a dado blade on the table saw to hollow out the center of one cedar slab, then applying two extra edge pieces onto its sides to create a continous-looking live edge effect. Lots of sanding happened before the edges seemed like they were just flowing into one another. After a week of working on it, the tray was sanded to perfect smoothness and finished with food-safe beeswax."
