    "One time, I found a relatively small, but flat slab of oak, and a broken-off piece from a giant oak slab. I decided to make the former into a cutting board, and the latter into two bat-shaped objects. They were sanded until extremely smooth to the touch, and laser engraved with Chinese characters that said 'Full Moon Board', and 'Great Oak Stick'. I find their side by side presence uncanny, but aesthetically pleasing."
