    "The most standout feature of these bedside tables is perhaps best seen from its back: one single piece of 3/4 inch plywood designed to bend and wrap around three oval-like platforms, upholding the entire structure.",
    "The back piece was designed on Rhino and cut on a CNC machine, with alternating 'one stripe, two stripe' patterns at equidistance to take out as much material as possible, making the slab of plywood extremely flexible yet sturdy. The legs were made by combining two pieces of 3/4 inch plywood, running them through a router table, and using the bandsaw to obtain the rounded peg shape at the top. The trickiest step was installing the loose components, which required applying constant pressure with rachet straps, and inserting screws into meticulously planned positions.",
    "The photos in this album are taken when the pieces are drying from polycrilic (and therefore flipped upside down). More photos will be available in the future."
