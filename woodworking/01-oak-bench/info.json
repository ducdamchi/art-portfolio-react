    "The inspiration for this piece came from my discovery of an oak slab that was discarded because of its irregular shape. Its extremely warped condition must have posed a challenge for both a planer and a CNC machine when it comes to getting a flat surface to work with. Interestingly, I noticed that the warpedness of the concave surface closely resembles a carved seat saddle. I decided to pose a challenge for myself: now that I don't have to carve a seat saddle, can I create a base structure that would support this seating surface?",
    "The process could be broken down into: (1) filling the gaps in the slab with black epoxy and sanding its surface, (2) make a firm bench base, and (3) connect the base to the slab. In order to match the asthetics of the warped seating surface, I decided to use uneven pieces to compose the base of the bench. This makes (3) become the biggest challenge: I had to do a version of a blind mortise and tenon joint, but with the mortise manually chiseled to fit the irregular shape of the bench base.",
    "This is the first substantial project I tried with hard wood, which took about 3 months to complete, bringing about many, many precious learning moments."
