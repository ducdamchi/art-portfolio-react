  "description": [
    "The design of this shelf came out of the necessity to add more storage to an irregularly shaped corner of a 20th century row home. The corner would fit a rectangular shelf, but I decided to extend the front edges to maximize surface area. This resulted in a Windows-shaped shelf, extremely wide in the front for ease of accessing kitchem supplies, and stretches deep into the back to increase storage space.",
    "The piece was completed in about three weeks."
