    "This photo series can best be described as the diary of a special roadtrip. The starting point was a small town two hours North of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the destination, a secluded campus in the middle of the Sierra Nevada desert, California. The participants were me, a Vietnamese photographer who had just barely arrived to the United States; T, a friend I had met in an international high school; and Fat Boy, a pit bull that T adopted the day before departure. When T got suspended half way through our high school program, he invited me to visit his home in New Mexico if I ever had the chance to. Three years later, I found myself celebrating Christmas with T in a small section-eight apartment, where his childhood friend and a hitchhiker from Kentucky were also crashing. The trip that I planned for T and I would take us to someone we both knew from high school. However, things went unexpectedly as I had kept T’s arrival a secret.",

    "Every shot in this series is contained within a one-month period in which the captured events took place. Thus, time plays an important role, as it is the main factor driving the narrative forward. By providing the viewer with this information and the background above, I hope to create a feeling of urgency that is less common in long-term photo projects. Specifically, there is a sense of constant arrival and departure against the backdrop of the American West that cannot be stopped because they had already happened—and in fact, been photographed. The captions, many of which were written in future tense, also play an important role. Firstly, they break the constraint imposed on the story by the time dimensionality; and secondly, they encourage the viewers to imagine what happened, or will happen, beyond the observations of the camera. Some imperfections from handling and processing the film, while unintentional, worked really well in provoking the affect of the trip—rough, hasty, and often unpredictable. Therefore, wherever relevant, I kept them for the purpose of heightening emotions that some exposures may provoke.",

    "I have tried various ways to contextualize this series, but they seem more like pieces of an incomplete puzzle rather than a nicely painted picture. Such contextualization also risks belittling the subjects in the series—real yet fragile, troubled yet charismatic people whose life go on independent from the black and white snapshots that captured but a small part of their complexities. It is perhaps best that I only provide the backbone of the narrative, and let viewers do the contextualization themselves. Regardless, during these fleeting encounters, I will say that there was a sentiment that I sensed in most subjects, including myself: the desire to seek stillness within changing conditions one did not choose. More often than not, this desire will fall short of itself. I decided to name the series after a remark that T once made: “I don’t mind the clouds as long as it’s not windy. I don’t mind the snow as long as it’s not windy. I don’t mind the cold as long as it’s not windy.”"
