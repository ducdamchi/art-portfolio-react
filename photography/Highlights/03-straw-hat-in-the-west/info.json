  "description": [
    "This series follows C as he traveled through the American West carrying something special: a straw hat with a red ribbon. In the famous manga One Piece, the protagonist is known for always wearing a hat with the exact same pattern. By bringing a symbol of Japanese pop culture into iconic landscapes of the United States, C had managed to create a playful stage in which he himself was the protagonist. There, C was acting out, quite literally, a comical moment in globalization.",

    "These images were made possible by the use of a Mamiya RB67--a much beloved medium format camera--that was randomly lent to me the night before departure. Because of the size and weight of the camera, plus the tripod to which it's always attached, I had to repack my entire carry-on bag to make space for this spontaneous addition. Carrying this setup on deep hikes into national parks, I gained a new appreciation for photographers like Ansel Adams, who pioneered the use of large format cameras to capture breathtaking landscapes of the American West.",
