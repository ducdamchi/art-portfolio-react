  "title": "WEDDING IN LOLO VILLAGE",
  "year": "2020",
  "description": [
    "I met Th the summer of 2020 while visiting Lung Cu, Ha Giang, the northernmost commune of Vietnam. He’d just finished military service and returned to his village, home to a big population of the Vietnamese Lolo ethnic group. At dinner, Th introduced me to his family and L, his then fianceé. After drinking lots of homemade corn wine, I received an invitation to their wedding in October.",
    "Vietnam is home to a total of 54 ethnic groups, of which the Lolo comprises a minority. They mainly settle in the Northen Mountain area, with distinct language, traditional costumes and cultural practices despite a population of less than 5000. As Ha Giang became more known in recent years for its natural beauty, people from Lolo Village are also embracing new revenue models, such as hosting visitors and offering homestay experiences. This was how I got to know Th and his family.",
    "When I arrived, Th and L had already had their engagement photo taken by a studio. With days to spare before their wedding, I wanted to offer a mundane perspective into the scenes behind this big ceremony-–gatherings in the house, actions in the yard, and sometimes just objects displayed on the wall. There was no catering services, and most people in the village rolled up their sleeves to prepare for this event--doing whatever one can, helping whenever one could. With only a thousand people in Lolo village, this was undoubtedly the spirit that bonded families and doubled enjoyments in both moments of labor and rest.",
    "Th and L are still living in Lolo village and recently had their second child.",
    "Special thanks to: An T., Linh T."
