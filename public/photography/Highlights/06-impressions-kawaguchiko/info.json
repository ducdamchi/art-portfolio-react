    "As the name may suggest, the “Impressions” series consist of projects conducted in culturally and geographically distinctive regions, often during a short amount of time. They are meant to provoke more than inform, the way new sights in a foreign country would catch a traveller’s attention. The images in these series, if they include people at all, frame them from a very safe distance—often reflecting my reluctance to intrude as an alien observer. Instinctively, this also meant relying a lot on sceneries that are already there, whether natural or manmade, to develop my visual understanding of a place.",
    "Minutes before my bus to Kawaguchiko departed, I found myself extremely lost in the middle of Shibuya junction. While frantically running around, I thought: “Unlike in Vietnam, this bus will probably leave very on time.” A passerby stopped to give me very detailed instructions, which I did not understand. Quickly realizing the situation, he told his friend to wait, and started running in the opposite direction, signaling me to follow. Until this day, I still think fondly of that encounter, it being the only reason why I was able to make it to Kawaguchiko and take the photos that I did.",
    "Kawaguchiko is one of the famous Fuji Five Lakes, located in a scenic town that offers many natural onsen, and a stunning view of Mount Fuji. The cloudy weather concealed the iconic volcano for many days—only clearing up a little the very morning that I had to leave."
